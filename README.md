dscord is a client libray for interacting with [Discord](https://discordapp.com). Currently dscord supports the majority footprint of the Discord API with some newer features and changes lacking.

## Development

For the moment dscord is in "maintence mode" which means no new features are being worked on but reported bugs will be investigated and any pull requests will be reviewed.

## Examples

If you're looking for sample code, or example implementations, the following are good places to start:

- [this repo's examples](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/dscord/tree/master/examples)
- [jeff](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/jeff), a friendly neighborhood Discord bot fully implemented in dscord.


## Compiling/Installing

Dscord is available on [dub](https://code.dlang.org/packages/dscord), and can be easily dropped into new or existing projects.

## Documentation

Some documentation is available [here](http://b1naryth1ef.github.io/dscord/).
